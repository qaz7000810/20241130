# Glocal Aggregations

"Glocal" stands for global datasets that allow for international comparisons, but are geographically granular enough to capture subnational variation. This project hopes to provide datasets that support both applied and academic research on economic development and related fields.

This repository houses the code used for creating the visualizations from the glocal aggregations data.

You can download the data from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6TUCTE).

A codebook for the collected data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0YqkrAhZBW8tK4TvkE7_JBaDa6OgRxV5VgBojAHo_Y/edit#gid=1303128934)
