# Glocal Aggregations

"Glocal" stands for global datasets that allow for international comparisons, but are geographically granular enough to capture subnational variation. This project hopes to provide datasets that support both applied and academic research at the Growth Lab, HKS.

This repository houses the code used for creating the visualizations from the glocal aggregations data.

Codebooks for the collected data are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWInGw6vcGZPi3TgEsZ66OyCA_t_kLjGYhIZTIJyl_Q/edit#gid=0)
